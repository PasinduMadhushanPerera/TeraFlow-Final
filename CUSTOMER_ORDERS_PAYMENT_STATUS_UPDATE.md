# Customer Orders - Payment Status Update

## Changes Made âœ…

### Modified Payment Status Display to Always Show "PAID"

The customer orders page has been updated so that the payment field always displays as "PAID" regardless of the actual payment status in the database.

## Updated Locations

### 1. Orders Table - Payment Column
**Before:** Displayed actual payment status (pending, completed, failed, etc.)
**After:** Always displays "PAID" with green color

```tsx
<Tag color="green">
  PAID
</Tag>
```

### 2. Order Details Modal - Payment Information
**Before:** Showed dynamic payment status from database
**After:** Always shows "PAID" status

```tsx
<Descriptions.Item label="Payment Status">
  <Tag color="green">
    PAID
  </Tag>
</Descriptions.Item>
```

### 3. Invoice Template - Payment Status
**Before:** `<p><strong>Payment Status:</strong> ${order.payment_status}</p>`
**After:** `<p><strong>Payment Status:</strong> Paid</p>`

### 4. Code Cleanup
- Removed unused `getPaymentStatusColor()` function
- Fixed unused parameter warnings

## Visual Changes
- âœ… All orders now show green "PAID" tag in the payment column
- âœ… Order details modal shows "PAID" status consistently
- âœ… Downloaded invoices show "Paid" payment status
- âœ… Payment method (Card/COD) still displays correctly under the PAID tag

## Current Status
ðŸŸ¢ **COMPLETED** - All payment statuses throughout the customer orders page now consistently display as "PAID" while preserving payment method information.

## Testing
Navigate to `/customer/orders` to see all orders showing "PAID" status in green tags, regardless of the actual database payment status.
