# ✅ PRODUCT IMAGE UPLOAD - ISSUE RESOLVED

## 🐛 Problem Identified and Fixed

### Issue
The database table was missing the `gallery_images` column, causing SQL errors:
```
Error: Unknown column 'gallery_images' in 'field list'
```

### Solution Applied
1. **Database Migration**: Added missing `gallery_images` JSON column to products table
2. **Backend Restart**: Restarted server with updated schema
3. **Verification**: Confirmed table now has both image columns:
   - `image_url` (VARCHAR 500) - for main product image
   - `gallery_images` (JSON) - for multiple gallery images

## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ Backend
- Server running on port 5000
- Database connection stable
- Image upload endpoints ready
- File upload middleware configured

### ✅ Frontend

### ✅ Database
