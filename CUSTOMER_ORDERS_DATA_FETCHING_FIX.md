# ✅ CUSTOMER ORDERS DATA FETCHING ISSUE - RESOLVED

## 🎯 Problem
The customer orders page was not fetching any data and showing empty results.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the backend `customerController.js` - the `getOrders` function was trying to query database columns that didn't exist:

### ❌ Missing/Incorrect Columns:
- `subtotal` - doesn't exist (should use `total_amount`)
- `shipping_cost` - doesn't exist (should use `delivery_fee`) 
- `payment_details` - doesn't exist (needed to construct from available fields)
- `special_instructions` - doesn't exist (should use `notes`)
- `customer_info` - doesn't exist (needed to construct from `customer_name`, `customer_email`, `customer_phone`)

This caused a 500 Internal Server Error when the frontend tried to fetch customer orders.

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Database Query in CustomerController
**File**: `TerraflowBackend/controllers/customerController.js`
**Function**: `getOrders`

**Changes Made**:
```javascript
// OLD - Non-existent columns
SELECT o.subtotal, o.shipping_cost, o.payment_details, o.special_instructions, o.customer_info

// NEW - Correct column mapping  
SELECT 
  o.total_amount as subtotal, 
  o.delivery_fee as shipping_cost, 
  o.notes as special_instructions,
  o.customer_name, o.customer_email, o.customer_phone
```

### 2. Constructed Missing Objects
```javascript
// Create customer_info object from available fields
order.customer_info = {
  fullName: order.customer_name || 'N/A',
  email: order.customer_email || 'N/A', 
  phone: order.customer_phone || 'N/A'
};

// Create payment_details object
order.payment_details = {
  method: order.payment_method || 'N/A'
};
```

### 3. Server Configuration
- **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:5000 ✅
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3001 ✅
