# Customer Orders - Payment Method Update

## Changes Made âœ…

### Modified Payment Method Display to Always Show "Card Payment"

<Text type="secondary" style={{ fontSize: 11 }}>
  Card Payment
</Text>
```

### 2. Order Details Modal - Payment Information
**Before:** Showed "Credit/Debit Card" or "Cash on Delivery" 
**After:** Always shows "Credit/Debit Card"

```tsx
<Descriptions.Item label="Payment Method">
  Credit/Debit Card
</Descriptions.Item>
```

### 3. Invoice Template - Payment Method
**Before:** `<p><strong>Payment Method:</strong> ${order.payment_method}</p>`
**After:** `<p><strong>Payment Method:</strong> Credit/Debit Card</p>`
