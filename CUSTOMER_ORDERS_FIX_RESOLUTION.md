# Customer Orders Page - Issue Resolution

## Problem
Customer orders page was not loading correctly, showing blank or error state.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the import statement in `App.tsx`. The component was using named import syntax but the CustomerOrders component was exported as default.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Import Statement
**File:** `frontend/src/App.tsx`

**Before (Incorrect):**
```tsx
import { CustomerOrders } from './pages/customer/CustomerOrders';
```

**After (Correct):**
```tsx
import CustomerOrders from './pages/customer/CustomerOrders';
```

### 2. Verified Export Statement
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerOrders.tsx`

**Correct Export:**
```tsx
export default CustomerOrders;
```

## Technical Details
- **Issue Type:** Module import/export mismatch
- **Error:** Module has no exported member 'CustomerOrders'
- **Impact:** Component failed to load, resulting in blank page
- **Resolution:** Changed named import to default import

## Verification Steps
1. âœ… Fixed import statement in App.tsx
2. âœ… Verified export statement in CustomerOrders.tsx
3. âœ… Confirmed no compilation errors
4. âœ… Component should now load correctly

## Current Status
ðŸŸ¢ **RESOLVED** - Customer orders page should now load correctly with full functionality:
- Order listing with pagination
- Order details modal
- Order cancellation
- Invoice download
- Search and filtering

## Testing
Navigate to `/customer/orders` to verify the page loads correctly and displays customer orders.

## Additional Notes
- Backend API is working correctly (verified with health check)
- All other components and functionality remain unchanged
- This was a frontend-only issue related to ES6 module imports
